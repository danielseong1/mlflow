## Original Todo
- When Tools overview shows zero errors, display a large check mark icon in the middle of the error rate card
- Should replace the standard chart when error count is zero
- Use design system check mark icon with appropriate styling
- Should maintain consistent card layout and spacing

## Description
Add a large centered CheckCircleIcon above the "No tool errors found" text in the TrendsToolErrorCard success state. This provides clear visual feedback when there are zero tool errors, making the success state more prominent and user-friendly.

**Current State**: The card shows "No tool errors found" text but no visual success indicator.

**Desired State**: Large green check mark icon centered above the text when errorCount === 0.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Modify TrendsToolErrorCard success state (src/trends/pages/tools/TrendsToolErrorCard.tsx)
- [x] Add large centered CheckCircleIcon above "No tool errors found" text
- [x] Use theme.typography.fontSizeXl for icon size
- [x] Use theme.colors.textValidationSuccess for green color
- [x] Add proper spacing with theme.spacing.sm
- [x] Keep consistent error icon in card header
- [x] Test with both zero errors and some errors scenarios
- [x] Verify icon scales properly at different screen sizes
- [x] Run code quality checks (lint, prettier, type-check)
- [x] Self-verification: Code review and component structure validation
- [x] Self-verification: Confirmed proper theme usage and design system compliance
- [x] Self-verification: Verified conditional rendering logic for success state
- [x] Self-verification: Complete code quality checks passed (lint, prettier, type-check, targeted tests, i18n, knip, theme compliance)
- [x] User test: Navigate to Tools Analytics page and verify large green check mark appears when no tool errors found
- [x] Verification: Manual testing with dev server - test both zero errors and some errors states
- [x] Verification: Screenshot both states to confirm visual differences
- [x] Verification: Cross-browser testing in Chrome dev environment
- [x] Verification: Responsive testing at different screen sizes
- [x] Verification: Confirm no regression in existing error state display

## Notes
Based on analysis of QualityAssessmentCard.tsx:137-143 pattern for large centered icons.

**Implementation Complete**: Successfully added large centered CheckCircleIcon to TrendsToolErrorCard success state with proper theme styling and spacing. Code quality checks passed (lint, prettier, type-check). Dev server confirmed running.

**Header Icon Fix**: Fixed card header to use WarningIcon for consistency with error cards (instead of CheckCircleIcon). Reran complete quality checks suite - all passed.

**Verification Complete**: User confirmed implementation works correctly with both error and success states. Task successfully completed and ready for PR.
